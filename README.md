# Technical Evaluation Amenitiz

**OTA Code Challenge**

## Hi, I'm Jed

I've been a Ruby on Rails developer since 2008. This cash register application demonstrates my approach to building scalable, maintainable software that meets business requirements while remaining flexible for future changes.

### Approach to This Challenge
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Carefully studied the flexible pricing requirements and CEO/COO preference changes
2. **Architecture Design**: Choose strategy pattern for pricing rules to enable easy modifications
3. **Implementation**: Built core functionality with TDD approach
4. **Validation**: Ensured all test scenarios pass correctly
5. **Documentation**: Clear code structure and inline comments

### Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Ruby 3.4.5, Rails 8.0.2
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16
- **Testing**: RSpec
- **Code Quality**: RuboCop for consistent styling and best practices

I believe in writing code that not only works today but can be easily understood and modified by future developers. This project showcases my ability to balance immediate requirements with long-term maintainability.
